title: "PE: A Poincare Explanation Method for Fast Text Hierarchy Generation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'The black-box nature of deep learning models in NLP hinders their widespread application. The research focus has shifted to Hierarchical Attribution (HA) for its ability to model feature interactions. Recent works model non-contiguous combinations with a time-costly greedy search in Eculidean spaces, neglecting underlying linguistic information in feature representations. In this work, we introduce a novel method, namely Poincar\'e Explanation (PE), for modeling feature interactions using hyperbolic spaces in an  time complexity. Inspired by Poincar\'e model, we propose a framework to project the embeddings into hyperbolic spaces, which exhibit better inductive biases for syntax and semantic hierarchical structures. Eventually, we prove that the hierarchical clustering process in the projected space could be viewed as building a minimum spanning tree and propose a time efficient algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.'

excerpt: 'The minimal feature removal problem in the post-hoc explanation area aims to identify the minimal feature set (MFS). Prior studies using the greedy algorithm to calculate the minimal feature set lack the exploration of feature interactions under a monotonic assumption which cannot be satisfied in general scenarios. In order to address the above limitations, we propose a Cooperative Integrated Dynamic Refining method (CIDR) to efficiently discover minimal feature sets. Specifically, we design Cooperative Integrated Gradients (CIG) to detect interactions between features. By incorporating CIG and characteristics of the minimal feature set, we transform the minimal feature removal problem into a knapsack problem. Additionally, we devise an auxiliary Minimal Feature Refinement algorithm to determine the minimal feature set from numerous candidate sets. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to address the minimal feature removal problem in the field of natural language processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CIDR is capable of tracing representative minimal feature sets with improved interpretability across various models and datasets.'

title: "PE: A Poincare Explanation Method for Fast Text Hierarchy Generation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'The black-box nature of deep learning models in NLP hinders their widespread application. The research focus has shifted to Hierarchical Attribution (HA) for its ability to model feature interactions. Recent works model non-contiguous combinations with a time-costly greedy search in Eculidean spaces, neglecting underlying linguistic information in feature representations. In this work, we introduce a novel method, namely Poincar\'e Explanation (PE), for modeling feature interactions using hyperbolic spaces in an  time complexity. Inspired by Poincar\'e model, we propose a framework to project the embeddings into hyperbolic spaces, which exhibit better inductive biases for syntax and semantic hierarchical structures. Eventually, we prove that the hierarchical clustering process in the projected space could be viewed as building a minimum spanning tree and propose a time efficient algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.'
